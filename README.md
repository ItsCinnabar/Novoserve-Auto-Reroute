# Novoserve-Auto-Reroute

Novoserve offers a reroute utility which will set their traffics route to you for 10 days. This means to ensure the best routes, you need to run the utility every 10 days. This program will automate the process for you. Simply set the py file to be run via your OS automation of choice (Task schedular, Systemd, Cron, etc).

You will need selenium and pyderman, so run "pip install selenium" and "pip install pyderman" once.
